							<h3><br/>Objective</h3>
							<p>
								We at Kodlab set out to combine the robust locomotive capabilities of Ghost Robotics' Spirit with a two-layered vision system 
								that enables smart navigation. The idea was to eventually couple this navigation with dynamic behaviors such as mounting, climbing,
								and jumping over obstacles to maneuver through a cluttered environment.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our immediate goal was to enable the robot to follow the human in sight around obstacles. My responsibility was 1) to assist in the 
								C++ software development of this navigation, and 2) to port the ROS1 navigation code to work with the ROS2 Spirit code.
							</p>
							
							<h3>Action</h3>
							<p>
								When I joined the project, ROS nodes for each desired behavior had been developed. However, some were not successfully integrated
								into the system or became corrupted over versions of the software. For instance, Spirit could identify obstacles with the LiDAR sensor
								and navigate itself, but the camera-based semantic classification system did not work. Sometimes, the system would crash entirely
								based on core dump or segmentation fault errors.
							</p>
							<p>
								Fixing the errors tested my problem solving ability. I commented out entire nodes, then functions, then code blocks and arrived at the culprit
								code through process of elimination. 
							</p>
							<p>								
								For why the nodes themselves would not work, I found that RQT Graph was my greatest ally. I tracked	20+ topics through nodes and 
								matched them with .cpp files and ran through the code. I discovered that the issue was related to launch files	incorrectly	
								launching the right nodes to enable the behavior. Finally, I integrated the <italic>ros2bridge</italic> into the system to allow 
								it to work seamlessly with the new Spirit code.
							</p>
							
							<h3>Result</h3>
							<p>
								We were able to achieve a functioning navigation system based on the internal walk behavior provided by Ghost Robotics.
								Spirit could detect humans and move towards them and navigate around obstacles to achieve this goal.
							</p>
							
							<h3>Areas of Improvement</h3>
							<p>
								Further tuning was necessary to instruct Spirit the boundaries through which its small body can pass through. As seen in the video above
								at 1:02, the bounding boxes around the obstacles were set too large and Spirit would not move around them even if it physically could.
							</p>
							<p>
								Finally, we were in a position to integrate in-house dynamic behaviors to this navigation feature. The would allow Spirit to choose
								the behavior it must execute to maneuver through complex environments, like climbing or jumping over obstacles.
							</p>
