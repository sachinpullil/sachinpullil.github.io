							<h3><br/>Objective</h3>
							<p>
								Blocking is a strategy used in f1/10 autonomous racing wherein the lead car (AKA the blocking car) adjusts its position along the
								track depending on the position of the car behind it (AKA the overtaking car). When effectively executed, this allows the blocking
								car to maintain the lead. The key advantage to blocking is that it can be used even with a <italic>speed handicap</italic> - the 
								blocking car can be	slower than the overtaking car and still hold the lead position.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our objective was to implement the blocking strategy using model predictive control and leverage its flexibility to integrate safety
								considerations within the optimization problem.
							</p>
							
							<h3>Action</h3>
							<p>
								We first assumed knowledge of the position of the overtaking car (easy to do in ROS). Then, we projected its trajectory along the 
								track for the next 5 seconds. Based on this projection, we generated a trajectory for our blocking car to follow. Then, we applied
								model predictive control based on the dynamics of the vehicle to follow this trajectory. We repeated these steps at a frequency of 10Hz.
							</p>

							<p>
								For safety considerations, we applied a cost on the change in steering angle between timesteps. This was to prevent the blocking car from
								taking wild turns which may cause collision or toppling of the vehicle.
							</p>						
							
							<h3>Result</h3>

							<p>
								We showed that our blocking strategy successfully allowed the lead car to defend its position when its speed was up to <b>5.4x slower</b> than
								the overtaking car. This was because the overtaking car could not react fast enough to the defensive steering of the lead vehicle. This
								proves that blocking using MPC can be a viable strategy for f1/10th autonomous racing.
							</p>
							
							<h3>Areas of Improvement</h3>
							<p>
								Unfortunately, the convex optimization solver could not always provide a solution even if one clearly existed. This led to intermittent
								stops of the vehicle while executing the blocking strategy. There needed to be backup measures for when the MPC solver returned no
								solution.
							</p>
							<p>
								Also, while in simulation it was simple to communicate position of the overtaking car to the blocking car, in real car testing, this
								information could not be stably communicated. The car-to-car communication system also needs improvement to test this strategy at
								high speeds.
