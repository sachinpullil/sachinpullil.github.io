							<h3><br/>Objective</h3>
							<p>
								The goal of this project was to build expertise in homogenous transformations, forward and inverse kinematics, and safe
								planning. We were tasked with programming a robot arm to pick up blocks and stack them with the white side of the block
								pointing upwards.
							</p>
							
							<h3>Action</h3>
							<p>
								Our first step was to build the kinematic model for the robot by computing the transformation matrices between the joints.
								Next, we realized that the key element in this project was the warm start. If we asked the inverse kinematics solver to
								get us joint angles for any target end effector pose, it may take a long time or even fail without a good initial guess.
								Hence, we realized we should solve the inverse kinematics problem for relevant poses beforehand and simply use a lookup
								table for those poses. Then, for poses nearby, that pose can serve as a warm start to the solver.
							</p>
							<p>								
								Then, we looked at approach strategies. Depending on where the white side of the block faced (up, down, towards robot,
								away from robot, or to the sides), our approach to the block needed to be different.We built six different strategies to
								approach and calculated the joint angles for those positions through inverse kinematics.
							</p>
							<p>
								Finally, we had to look at safety. We could not let the end effector collide with the table or any blocks during its work.
								For this, we ensured that the paths that we took to achieve these motions would always have clearance around blocks
								and the stacked tower we were building.
							</p>							
							
							<h3>Result</h3>
							<p>
								Our robot was able to successfully stack blocks without colliding with any of the blocks or the surrounding environment.
							</p>							
							
							<h3>Areas of Improvement</h3>
							<p>
								In a friendly competition between teams, we witnessed our robot stop working because the sensors detected that it was
								too close to the table and predicted a collision. However, this never occurred in numerous tests in simulation. We realized
								that we may not have tested the algorithm enough times on the real robot - it's likely that the real robot needed greater
								clearance between the table, blocks, and the end effector for safety. This was my first encounter with the sim2real gap.
