							<h1>Legged Behavior Design for a Quadrupedal Robot</h1>

							<h3><br/>Objective</h3>
							<p>At Kodlab, we were deeply interested in <i>mobimanipulation</i> - the idea of using only the limbs
								of the robot to manipulate its environment. Kodlab PhD alumni V. Vasilopoulos
								and T. Topping were able to achieve this on Ghost Robotics' Minitaur (as shown in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/pOTcxosbOe0?start=105" target="_blank"> this</a> video around 1:45).</p>
							<p>My objective was to achieve similar, purely feed-forward mobimanipulation on Ghost Robotics' Spirit. This new quadruped
								has 3 degrees of freedom in each leg, which enable it to perform dynamic movements that more closely align with 
								quadrupeds in nature. Specifically, I set out to adapt the <b>Mount</b> behavior to jump on the cart and the <b>Push Walk</b> behavior to move the cart around.
							</p>
							<h3>Action</h3>
							<p>
								The mount behavior designed by Timothy Greco, a PhD student at Kodlab, worked well in simulation. However, the push walk behavior needed work.
								The core issues were improper initial grip on the cart, unintended yaw while pushing the cart forward, and unstable center of mass (COM) of the robot while push walking.
							</p>
							<p>
								To fix the grip issue, I tuned the mount parameters so that before we begin push walk, the rubber feet of the robot land on the cart, instead of the metallic shins.
								The yaw issue was related to the unstable COM while walking. For this, I calculated the stable area where the COM should be while the robot is
								on three legs as it takes a step. I discovered the COM would be outside this stable area and therefore cause the robot to roll every time it took a step.
								To fix this, I moved the rear legs outward and backwards during the step to create a wider stable area. This created a stable behavior in simulation.
							</p>
							<p>
								Further issues were discovered when moving from simulation to real robot testing. I had to tune and discover a different set of gains which would stabilize the
								mount and push walk behavior on the real robot. I also had to tune step lengths further to improve the stability of the walk.
							</p>
							<h3>Result</h3>
							<p>
								The mount behavior successfully allowed Spirit to jump on the cart landing feet first, thus allowing a strong grip to push the cart. The push walk behavior successfully
								allowed Spirit to push the cart forward, however further investigation is needed into improving its stability.
							</p>
							<h3>Areas of Improvement</h3>
							<p>
								As the robot pushes the cart forward, there is a counter-clockwise arc in the cart's trajectory. This could be improved by further investigating the roll in the push walk behavior, 
								which increases the likelihood of uneven steps and therefore results in yawing of the cart. We could also add a feedback system using cameras or the robot's own IMU to correct for
								the yaw and have the robot push the cart in the opposite direction.
